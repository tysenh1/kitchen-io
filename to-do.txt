Need to work on prompt engineering so that it actually asks for stuff more than once before just recommending stuff
Also need to improve seed data because theres fuck all right now so the ai doesn't feel the need to ask multiple questions
database needs to be improved because this bitch is gonna slow down when I get more than like 200 recipes in there

^^^ need to figure out allergens and that stuff in code and also like all of the item code on the backend lmao ^^^

Need to start getting the program together that will actually do the adding and maybe even removing of items in the db.

Ai is mostly set right now, at least in the sql queries and other code (some code might need to be removed). Prompt needs improvement though.

write a proper readme for this
