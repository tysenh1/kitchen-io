Need to work on prompt engineering so that it actually asks for stuff more than once before just recommending stuff
Also need to improve seed data because theres fuck all right now so the ai doesn't feel the need to ask multiple questions
database needs to be improved because this bitch is gonna slow down when I get more than like 200 recipes in there

^^^ need to figure out allergens and that stuff in code and also like all of the item code on the backend lmao ^^^

Need to start getting the program together that will actually do the adding and maybe even removing of items in the db.

Ai is mostly set right now, at least in the sql queries and other code (some code might need to be removed). Prompt needs improvement though.

write a proper readme for this

Need to make allergens more human-readable on the frontend so that when the user edits them, they actually know whats up
    Allergens actually need to be properly done and maybe style the form on the frontend better while you're at it

Allergens need to be implemented on the backend after the above is done

Logic needs to be inplace so that when an item is submitted to the db thats already in it, it doesn't error out but updates the quanitty in the pantryu
    quantities and adding items to the pantry needs to be figured out before this.
