Fetch multiple food facts databases if there is missing information for one of them so the user just has to review instead of always adding details for missing fields.

Add the docker script for the local llms if the user wants to set the application up with an llm

Maybe make a status symbol with health checks for all the components on the frontend?
    Like a status for the api, llm chatbot, OFF database, things like that. 

Also maybe include a fuzzy find step for scanning items that are in the db already, but different quantities.

Finish off the readme

flow of adding an item to db:
    User scans in an item
    item is fetched from OFF (open food facts db)
    item is returned to the user with possible generic names for the item fetched from the "generic_name" database
    user inputs correct information and ships back the item, adding a new generic name if the one currently in the db doesn't work
